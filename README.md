# Garden Bar Stock
## Project Portofolio Three
At the Garden Bar the stock was made using the classic pen and paper tool. The bar's popularity increased so it became very buisy. The stuff couldn't handle making the stock anymore and so this command-line aplication was created for helping staff to save time and to be more precise with the bar's inventory.

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy
* The application will provide a easier way to calculate the stock and revenue data.
* When created the application the initial stock will be already stored in google spreadsheet.
* The application will request the user to input entries data.
* Adding initial stock to entries data, the total stock will be calculated.
* The application will request the user to input sales data.
* Substract sales from total stock data, the final stock will be calculated.
* The data from final stock will be imported to initial stock data so it can be used for the next day calculation.
* The prices for each drink will be provided in the spreadsheet.
* Multiplying sales with drinks prices the revenue for the day will be calculated.
