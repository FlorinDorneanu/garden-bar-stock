# Garden Bar Stock
## Project Portofolio Three
At the Garden Bar the stock was made using the classic pen and paper tool. The bar's popularity increased so it became very buisy. The stuff couldn't handle making the stock anymore and so this command-line aplication was created for helping staff to save time and to be more precise with the bar's inventory.
